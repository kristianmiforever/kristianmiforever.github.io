            Dear Kristian,<br>
            <br>
           How have you been doing? And your fam nga pala? Hehe I am naturally shy but here I am right now, I mustered all my courage to take the risk and send my first ever love letter to you. It's very ironic how first time ko ito, pero nung di na tayo. More cute love letters if naging tayo ;) Crush ko kasi guy best friend ko eh! Huhu pano na yan HAHAHA ok nasshy na ko kasi first time kong magconfess via letter to you :> You know, I feel so happy that I get to focus more on myself right now. I get to play games, draw, cook, workout, read, sing, dance, clean, and watch, which I wasn't always able to do before because busy sa life... So many things pa na you didn't know I did! HAHA lol sad lang tho, daming nangyayari sa world. Anyways, I wanna tell you how grateful I am to have you in my life. You opened me to so many things I didn’t expect to happen. Back when we first met in goks, I was shocked how boldly you were to tell me you knew about me. We had this spark, but I forgot about you the next day, sadly (who u??). Since the Draw Something, we chatted everyday until last April. You were so chatty? in love irdk? during that first term to the point I got overwhelmed and annoyed by it. I really have this bad impression of you since you had a lot of girls in the past plus they said malandi ka (thanks to corinne and ie peeps oopsie) but you proved me wrong. We were opposites. You were not the boy next door, and I was the girl next door. I thought we were incompatible at first, like idol kita nun tho I feel so far from you, but our internal energies reflect. I have this side where I want to be social/wild/free spirited while you wanted to be lowkey/soft/nice. We became best friends then MU. Every time spent with you feels like home, and always felt like we’ve known each other for a long time ago. We shared secrets to each other, then I remembered how we were always hanging in SA, then you suddenly cried out loud and leaned on my shoulder (awe what a softie hugs). We also have this chemistry, and we were okay if we don't have much in common, as long as we get to like and understand each other's interests and get to know more of our commons as best friends. I learned to love myself and the people around me more because it was in your nature to be caring and loving. It’s as if you’re overflowing with love for others, even though you knew that you lacked self-love (health, insecurities, etc) and strength also. I remembered something from Animusika 2019, you told me that your past relationships usually fail because you feel that you’re not enough for them and you always escape a fight(bc you’re scared to fix it? I forgot the reason)... it was like us jumping to a hole, your past bothered you so much that even though you like me so much, you told me we can stop further, but I comforted you to stay strong from your insecurities and past trauma, and that I believe in you even if you still feel like a disappointment. Before we committed, I asked you multiple times if you would pursue me despite our differences, and you always say you would accept me, and I’m glad to know. We have imperfections, physically and personality-wise, but I try to tolerate yours out of love. There are weird quirks too but I learned to not only tolerate, but love them as well. But it’s good both of us are trying to improve for the better. I also recalled you saying last September 21, 2019, “Like a single sunflower in a field of peonies, beautiful and unique in its own special way.” I never saw the survey ever again, but I remembered it in my heart and in my mind, from being all shy, us nuzzling while watching the stars, cuddling, kissing, to being comfortable even watching the other pooping and showering in the comfort room (lol). Despite my high standards, I received the sign I’ve been asking for and you were my answered prayer. I got attracted and fell in love with you and accepted you for who you’re despite your flaws. Love became a choice. I also like how you were persistent but I knew I was usually the receiver. I ask if you need something, but you said you like to give than to receive, so I was “okay bubu”. I want to admit that I felt how lucky I am to have you as my partner, especially you’re a gentleman. You always push me to be better. I storytell people about you and they admire how perfect we are, but I know we have flaws too. I also want to tell you that I want to give sometimes even if you don’t directly tell me. I want to cook, play, and have fun with you, be your helping hand in reaching your dreams, make you laugh more, and provide you with your desires. I admit that maybe I was a bit selfish before, because even though I want to give you more of what you deserve, I wasn’t able to kasi lagi akong busy mag-aral/orgworks, but I see that you’re understanding and happy. Like your face tells me so much about how you love the time spent with me, so I feel happy that you’re very happy. Remember that no one's demanding raw time, though we might have taken each other's time - free time. I never complained that we usually hang, even though I'm an introvert and needed more "me time"... maybe because I thought were still in the honeymoon stage, and I told myself when ecq started, for sure next time it would be balanced na. Okay guilty ako doon sa I like food and going to your place HAHA I get grumpy when I'm hungry, sorry :( Oki lang sa akin tho na kahit di mo ko lagi iinvite naman sa condo mo, I was just nagpaparinig na pabiro lang nun HAHA However, I still made you feel obligated of me even though I want to assure you I'm actually okay if we don’t always hang out so that we can have a life also as an individual. Go lang naman ako if you want to talk/hang with anyone, as long as we’re still partners by heart and the trust is there. We don't need to talk 24/7. I want us to live in the moment and both of us should still continuously find what we want to do with life (bc this is the age group when we want to enjoy but feel lonely and confused about the future but it's good to have someone by your side). I remembered during first term, we would usually eat outside 2x a week omg ang gastos HAHAH nung second term naman, I would usually hang in your place at night to teach you, study, or have fun when I should be in my place with my family. (Sorry I got frustrated teaching you bc I am not a good teacher also other than math. Tbh I always believe in you like I can see you work so hard but I tried to be around in the condo just to also give you tips from experience, help you prove something to your family, and reach your goals. I never intend to be a distraction to you or make you feel low of yourself). It was because you said we’re peaceful and you can’t imagine your life when I wasn’t around, baka kung ano na ginagawa mo sabi mo so I decided to stay by your side. We’re happy and all, yes. But I guess too much is too much. It was okay if you told me the truth before, I can listen and understand. I wasn't that aware before, since honeymoon stage pa. I promise I won't take up all your free time anymore this time. Kahit mas madikit tayo nung first term, we can take turns in giving and receiving naman and that we can set boundaries on communicating and seeing each other, if it already interferes with our daily activities. You can tell me so that we can agree in the middle. The adjustment was still in the process since we just lasted half a year, so it will be normal if we argue and be patient on it til we get there and be comfortable. Not everything is always smooth sailing, they say. Couples usually argue around a few times a week on something even as small as food, but making up or not, they still love each other at the end of the day. Shocked nga lahat ng tao na never tayong nag-away for more than 6 months HAHA you haven't even seen me get angry in person lol. I am a hungry person but it doesn’t mean I should let you eat with me also when you are not in the mood pero wala lang, turns out ako lang pala gutumin sksksk HAHA jk kaya sorry na, no need for grudges anymore, since now I'm more aware that it affects you, I promise that will never happen again. It shows though my parents like you a lot since they cook food for you even though I never told them to do so then concerned silang magutom ka. Kahit dinner they’ll invite you over, but you may politely tell them na you need to get back by this certain time for work or decline. We wanted to hang with friends and study but we don’t seem to balance it yet. That’s why I want to say sorry for making you feel this way. Pareho naman tayong may mali dito since both of us weren’t putting effort on balancing it. I hope we communicated more so that your overall health and our social life won’t be at stake also. It’s like the 20th birthday letter you gave me. You said we should balance the time starting term 2, but I guess our honeymoon stage got extended. Both of us were exerting so much energy into the relationship, that one of us thinks it’s already unfair even though we were really happy during those moments, and we can still give a chance at balancing. I appreciate the effort so much though even with little things, especially because we got to know each other’s family and friends, visit each other almost everyday at the doorstep, wait for each other, and that we constantly update & support each other even reviewing, a night out, or trip abroad. I'm super thankful kasi sobra binigay mo, kahit naiisip ko minsan, "what did I do to deserve so much love?" Sobrang helpful mo as in kahit mag-drawing ka lang sa tabi ko o doon ka lang sa isang side nagg-games or kahit "good luck!" lang sa chat hehehe like presence mo palang, enough na! Though normal naman if we have fights, basta we try to brush it off and laugh it out soon, unless very alarming/bothering na kailangan iaddress talaga. Tbh I feel heavy ever since late January due to burnout from school. I always pray that I’ll feel better everyday, and you were like an angel sent from heaven, always there to make me feel positive... thank you for always giving me a push! I wouldn’t be this motivated if it weren’t for you. How are your grades btw? Hopefully okay rin grades mo hehehe you’re sooo hardworking and amazing kayaaa. I just wish you'd start seeing that! :3 <br>
           <br>
           When you made a mistake last February and April, I was nagtatampo at first, you said “ayaw ko na”, and I really got impulsive saying “we’re over”, dropping the phone when I didn’t even hear your side during that call. Dapat I became stronger that time for us also and waited for your answer and not drop it. I used more of my emotions bc syempre galit instead of thinking first. I regretted it. When you texted “let’s talk again tomorrow”, my emotions were still all over the place and I couldn't stop texting you. It was wrong, I know. As for me, I’ve been having weird anxiety episodes when ecq started. Aside from anxiety from schoolworks, coronavirus anxiety also hit me and I became too clingy not seeing people and was worried about loved ones getting sick, business also getting bad since no customers etc. (Lol di nga nagkacovid, nagkamental degrade naman yikes) Since March, I’ve been getting headaches during online classes and feeling extremely tired. I feel suffocated at home. Plus I had this feeling of uncertainty of the future, heaviness in the chest, more moody/sensitive at home, and have a hard time breathing when I’m overthinking that I’ve mistaken as a feeling from the relationship or something, but turns out it was all from the anxiety talaga and acads. Even though I was anxious, you became one of my happy pills to keep me moving forward amidst the suffocation brought by lockdown. Sorry, I didn’t bother to let you know though because I knew you had other stressors and probs too (acads, fam probs, etc). I still tried to be positive for us even though I was anxious because I still want to make you feel at ease despite the stress. Last April 9, I knew it should have been your lead but I was so assertive. Weird ng feeling tbh. I was very happy though you told me the truth, for me to eventually forgive you for the mistake, but I think you’re still guilty kasi feel mo kulang ka effort and you broke my trust. Love is powerful and forgiving, they say. So throw all of the guilt, both of us were wrong at establishing this condition after all, and it was already done. You sincerely saying the truth to me and being strong enough again for us was already enough for me to forgive you, and the condition was negotiable just like what other couples do. You’re not forgiving just for me, but for your own sake also. The trust was a bit broken at first, but can be mended eventually as long as we stick to our promise. Breaking up is not an easy way out to a problem, and I would never want to hear it again unless temporary “break” lang. Tbh the time I told you in CBTL (that I don’t date guys who smoke), the condition (which I’m now very sorry for), and the advice I told you before, I wanted to just tell you that I was just concerned for you. It’s your own choice whether to do it or not. I’ll accept you naman if you really want to use it for curiosity and enjoyment, since I'm open to the idea, basta di lang abusive (iykwim I'm certain naman na you're just using it to destress). If you want to quit, I can help you naman in a more consoling way. (I can be your drug nalang hihi yieee u r my drug lol ½ jk) It was because I liked you ever since. I was just worried for your sake. I sound like a mom :c but don’t take it as an offense. The condition can be broken pero mali pala nung sinabi natin pag ganito nangyari (calamansi, vices, etc).... magbbreakup. Even though others do it, dapat pala we didn’t say that to each other kasi it’s threatening and “toxic” in a way, sabi nga ng parents ko. “Break up” to me seems like a hard word now. I wouldn't like to use it or hear it ever again unless it was really meant, based on my previous mistakes. I was actually testing if you would fight for us (would be better if you did) if I said “we’re over" pero I also realized I initialized the condition for this issue kaya nag-reach out na rin ako. Sorry for everything since January 2019. I sounded manipulative and controlling, but I just cared for your health, that’s all. I wasn't hurt when you chose to do vices nung stressed ka, concerned lang. You’re still the one to control your body... not me, oki? Since you love me very much more than I do, mahal parin kita kahit ganyan ka. Moreover, I was really fascinated when my prayers were always heard when it’s about you (stop ng vape 2019 & you waiting for me to answer and may sign ako nareceive then you’re the one and “tuloy-tuloy” tayo til the future, tho di na ko sure sa latter prayer AHAHAHuhu i got the sign naman pero baka we just bumped into a rock?) <br>
            <br>
            Personally, I didn’t count this as a second chance since part siya dapat ng cool-off. I knew that after our shortened cool-off, it was not the proper timing since I was still stuck in the past & emotionally unstable (from “friends” problems and ecq anxiety which led me to be needy, clingy, and kept on asking for that "sorry" from before (kahit nasabi mo na), attention, and reassurance from you instead), and you were not yet ready also at that time due to guilt and feeling of being controlled (kaya I said you appear to “gaslight” and shout in my dream even though you’re not irl is because you made me feel guilty for your choice (“diba this is what you like, edi eto”, you said) even though it should be also what you like, but I understood why since dapat we gave each other more time pa). I wanted to have space also that time, in short di rin ako ready nun emotionally & mentally even though I kept pushing. I kept on crying when I was talking with you because of covid anxiety and missing my best friend. I think you never saw me cry pa in person. For the first time, when I made kwento of my dream, you heard me cry like a baby, how embarrassing HAHAHA never again :(( I cried due to anxiety, insecurities, and the dream itself. (AHAHA sino ba namang di magagalit sa dream na nag-break kayo kasi may nakita siyang ibang girl hmph pero after those days, laging dreams na babalik ka yung meron ako) You said I should have given you time to think about it, from April 9-May 9 (cool off) but I was so naive and immature back then. I should have waited longer so that we could reflect more and won't cling into our past mistakes anymore. Since first time ko rin, I didn’t know what cool off consists of, even though I was the one who initiated it. We then agreed on conditions, but I was still very pushy and pressuring, which made me appear clingy. I didn’t like what I did also, I’m sorry. Maybe if I was just more conscious, trying to balance it, and selfless for us from the start of our relationship, things would fall into proper places. Maybe if I wasn’t harsh towards you nung end of March, we would be alright. Maybe if I didn't drop the call, we could have compromised and be okay after. That would set as a good example of not to break up kagad pag may problem. Maybe if I tried to console you instead in times of stress, I wouldn’t have contributed more to your stress. I have personal problems and insecurities too stemming all from this pandemic, but I should have told you sooner, so both of us will feel safe and understood even if we’re vulnerable. As for me, I should have told you because the week that you came back, sakto nagpile up na lahat ng emotions ko, and naintindihan mo sana what was happening to me so that I won’t cry it all out to you. Hirap pala itago na everything's alright bc eventually magb-breakdown din. I had my emotions out of control, and nasama kita doon :( I didn't understand what's happening to me, like up down up down yung naffeel ko pero I knew there's something wrong with me since March... kaya sorry I kept it to myself then poured it all to you, crying that day we broke up. Next time I’ll tell you na if I feel there’s something wrong and I won’t leave you guessing anymore what I really need and want (kahit sa food etc). Pakipot and shy kasi ako AHAHAHA hays For now, I wanted us to just believe and support each other in times of sharp recession in all aspects, so that we can get through these problems we have (covid related probs etc) and be okay with the years to come. Maybe if I trusted the timing more and just waited for your lead that May 9th, maybe things would be different, I realized my mistakes too, and one side wouldn’t be hot-headed to the other. We could have resolved this issue, forgive each other, forget, and learn from it. We were already together by the 10th, when things weren’t that boiling, confusing, and suffocating yet. Or if not, extend the space needed to know the root cause of our problems and be more ready. I know I made you feel suffocated and controlling for everything that I’m doing, but you shouldn’t be. Sorry. That’s why I told myself that since I need to put your happiness first because I love you, I need to sacrifice a bit, let you wander for now, and be patient enough when you ask for time and space to heal, though I still contact you for being thankful and helping you realize stuff during your healing. I finally learned what cool off meant and what space does to people. It makes them take a step back, realize their mistakes, reflect from the situation, and find room for improvement. You get to find the root of your problems and heal the wounds. You get to also focus more on yourself and have self-growth & self-love in general. Tbh, mas masaya maging single, kasi since self lang iisipin, lesser problems. It’s really tempting but I fully decided not to since I know I can balance it na, and that I am ready to face anything with you. It can make us mature with our actions and be strong-willed. I became aware of my mistakes too from the space, so I'm happy na mas conscious na ko sa atin ngayon. If things would restart, I want us to have an individuality also aside from us being a couple. We should also respect each other's time, as we're not always free. I've noticed this was something we always lacked improvement on before. I realized also if we have mistakes, we should be mature enough to approach them. And that there are so many factors pa aside from love that will keep the relationship going, like constant communication, affection, compromise, assurance, and consistency to work things out. Even though I still have this pandemic anxiety, it made me have the readiness to forgive and to be more certain of the next step to recover our broken relationship. It made me be present-lived, and less worried about the future as it is still far and there is so much time to get ready for it, especially that covid-19 brings so much uncertainty. I found happiness in myself and collected more love so that I can give you the love you deserve from my overflow. I knew that this time we needed to try and balance what was in hand, and be more forgiving and understanding. I filled myself with happy thoughts onto my anxiety and our bad happenings, and I tried to find myself through soul-searching. This is the new normal and face-to-face meetups would seem impossible until 2021, I told myself. I also became more used to the lockdown, which helps me cope with the anxiety. As much as I care more of myself, I found myself still thinking about you at the start and end of the day. (You’re so lucky for that yiee, sana ako rin iniisip ni crush ahehe) I got to dream better when my insecurities were already going away, and I got to understand why this has happened to us. Aside from praying everyday to God for my healing, I also pray that you get to heal, as you’re the one who needs it more. I also pray our hearts to rest for now, but come back soon. Everytime I wake up, there's an aura of hope within me, and the Lord gives me confidence that we will reconnect very soon. For the whole term until now, I still pray every night that you also pass every subject. You might find yourself complicated to understand, but I can see it with just my eyes why you’re uncertain (someone in my dream last May 10+? told me that you have piled up past stress and traumas that resurfaced and I need to let you know that you don’t need to be shy to open up your problems to someone, including me and just console you... or you still haven't moved on from the baggage of your exes, or maybe bc of covid anxiety rin sa iyo so you also get weird mood swings and find vices to cope up idk?) and I understand. I never laughed at you when you share something, I actually feel sad for the happening. I promise I won’t give unsolicited advice + OTs anymore. I hope you have realized I’m different from your exes though, it was a pain to be compared lalo na “toxic” yung previous one talaga and I’m not like that. If I partly was, you can let me know and willing naman ako magbago. I learned that I should become stronger emotionally, to think critically, and to speak that is more comforting and not threatening. I realized that we should not rush things when we’re sad, but when we’re ready. I hope we both learned na di dapat dinamdamay ng personal problems yung relationship/friendship. I thought also if we’ll never try, we might regret it for a lifetime (just like how I slowly became ready, stopped being uncertain, and chose you last September 23). I learned also to take things slowly, make things flow naturally, and never rush it unless urgent (unlike after our shortened cool-off). I hope by this time, you’ve already healed from your piled up past traumas and guilt, forgave yourself, and filled it with love and forgiveness. Or at least you already found yourself, the root cause of your problems, and still in the process of completely healing. Hopefully you’ve passed through the stage of being cold and distant already. I really miss seeing you, and hearing your voice and thoughts. I would be glad enough if we will fully trust each other again in opening up our problems, happiness, and life stories again. I hope you have learned from the past and let it stay there, be present-lived, and to not overthink the future. I also hope you're more mature now to face any struggle. We can share our uncertainties. I want to also assure you that before I committed to you, I accepted you for who you are despite your flaws and personality. I already knew these mistakes could happen, but I didn’t get ready for such a mess because I believe that we won’t give up on each other forever. Nagkataon lang na nauna kang nagkamali. Both of us are imperfect so surely both of us will hurt each other, but forgiveness and patience will be the key to peace and love. If you want to improve, then that’s good for you and the people around you, and the same goes for me. So I hope you don’t feel insecure with yourself and intimidated around me. I was never disappointed in you inside our relationship. Your strengths are my weaknesses, and my strengths are your weaknesses. I am blessed to have you in my life, as much as you’re blessed to have me in your life. I will always continue to root for you even if people don’t believe in you anymore. I hope both of us will not be scared of failing again and again, as long as we get to address the problem and we’re at each other’s side. Better talaga if we work as a team. Although, we agreed that if one fails, the other should be stronger and can still make the other realize the situation, so I’m just doing my part. It is also true that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and I confirmed it with this scenario we had. It’s missing both a partner and a best friend. I hope you feel the same way too. Everytime I see the flower you gave me, the necklace you gave, and the cat light we have, it makes me think of you and my heart beats heavily. I see them every morning, hold them, and it sparks me joy amidst the lockdown. We only had a very short time together but the foundation was great. I recall our strolls and how happy we were, and how we teased each others’ weirdness. I remember our talks on our future plans including family, even though we are uncertain since we are still unstable. I sometimes watch our videos together in the Drive, remember you with the memes all over socials, and still use the workout app you suggested. I still want to hug you tight, kiss you, have heart-to-heart talks, arguments, showers, and plans with you, and have days together studying, playing, drinking out, singing and hanging with you and others. (I still want to see you poop and crawl in front of others jk :( HAHAH) When I draw and look at the painting I did before, I somehow remember how you were the most unique critique and motivator I ever had among my family and friends. Your presence is enough to inspire me everyday, sana naiispire rin kita. Even sometimes we disagree and clash with negative and positive energy, we somehow get to address, laugh it off, and set a middle ground. Just so you know, I care for you from afar and I have never wanted our relationship to die. People change, but we can still discover ourselves inside the relationship. You’re the best thing that happened to me, and no one can replace you. All of these are not only words, but things that I have reflected on, and that I still want to fix again for us. I'm here because I've already fully reflected and know our problem can still be resolved. It was just brought by the circumstance na both of us were mentally unstable, so we needed space. Sorry for everything and thankful ako nangyari ito sa atin. The space was really an eye-opener for us to improve on ourselves and reflect on us, and since we're now officially done with the honeymoon stage, we can continue moving forward from what we have paused. Remember that no matter how many ups and downs, heartbreaks, distance, and being hurt, love is the most powerful weapon to let two people love and reunite again and again. In time, love usually turns into a habit and it is normal, but we can fall in love all over again with just simple things as long as both people are willing to work it out. It is also sometimes confusing, but we need to communicate and be strong-willed that uncomfortableness turns into growth of the relationship over time. Loving someone is truly a choice (lalo na pag long-term), and there are so many good things and potential feelings (Check "MEMORIES") to hold this relationship we have even though we had downs and we’re not that in love as before. I really miss you and I love you still, Kristian.

            Hi bubu, <br>
            <br>
            I have my pre-period/period everytime we fight oops HAHA so may factor para maging moody rin ako nun :( thank you for keeping up with my moodiness and anxiety though! I also recalled I was told to prank you na magbreak on April fools (sabi ni achi Kristel) pero I know it’s a bad joke and di ko alam paano kaya nag-pikunan nalang tayo oof eto yata yung sa trans (it's ok if you're uninterested since nakakaoverwhelm din mga issues), I wanna tell u that time it was a prank but idk how to spill it bc we were so serious then I forgot to tell it to you the next days HAHAHA know that my parents don’t think of you badly on coming back again. They just think you’re confused and annoyed sa ginawa ko from the past so I should wait for you raw to come back (like the cool off dapat na we had). I don't mind anymore who broke up first because we're both worth it. I'm already taking back when I first said "we're over", and I'll accept you when I could have just heard your voice again. The next time we feel the relationship’s suffocating and too fast, we can talk about ways to cope up with it or if di talaga kinaya, tama ka nga na we should cool off since it will let us grow individually, reflect, and start from scratch again. I’m sorry for being imamature, emotional, and adding stress to you, even in small things, during this lockdown because I was anxious and weak too. I guess people are also bored na they cling to arguments para mag-talk, and that was sooo bad imo HAHA remember the vid i sent you na nag-aaway dalawang dogs lol that looks like us nung ecq HAHAHA. I'm sorry also for demanding reassurance and attention when I don't need to do so, since you are always enough naman for me and the best. This just happened out of my anxiety from the pandemic and insecurities. I'm sorry for also making you feel invalidated with your emotions on your ideas on fam business, even though you have a point pero since sinasabi ng dad mo na it's impossible, I should have just consoled you nalang instead of insisting. I'm glad to know that both of us are not high maintenance, so we can start from being a lowkey normal couple, since that's what I've really wanted ever since, and you too. We commit but don't feel obligated and give up everything na wala nang matira sa iyo. We're just here to support each other through the years, so that we can focus more on our other priorities too, like self, family, studies/ goals, hobbies, and friends. Take it just lightly like mag-best friends lang na couple til we're already working and stable enough. Never instill na one of us is alpha in the relationship, since we will give and take always to grow this time. Let’s be stronger individuals na, and be the woman and man we should be while having fun also! Let's not lose ourselves too while in the relationship, okii? We should be conscious of ourselves inside the relationship since tapos na talaga yung honeymoon stage. Keep your routine before we were together, maximize your freedom, and always discover yourself so that we can improve on our independent selves bc that's the most important selfish thing you can do for yourself! Then, when one's feeling bad (e.g. stressed), the other shouldn't reflect the same thing, but just give a hug and console. Thank you though for protecting my precious heart from getting hurt more when we were not the best version of ourselves that time. I understood what had happened to us, and I know mental health issues don’t go away as quickly. I admit I had a hard time from the past months, with such roller coaster of emotions that I didn't understand, and I regret na nadamay rin kita nun, sorry. But now I've healed, I’m here to understand and support you better, hug kita virtually, listen to you, and I’ll lighten up your mood hehehe 么么哒 pagsubok lang sa atin ito!! :3 I now also know na you're the kind of person na pag wala sa mood, you want some space or just need someone to listen to you and make you laugh para marelax ka, and I'm always here to listen, oki? I will never judge you or lecture you. I'll always look forward to the day your family will be proud of you! I believe in you and am proud of you! Remember grades don't define you. I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. I will always love listening and cheering to you, like what you usually do to me! I learned this from you :> *kiss cheeks* You being here is enough for me to be ready to get back to our promise to each other. I hope you're getting there too, kaya mo yan! I was once uncertain to you also before, but bringing back such happiness and light topics will be a good path to a better us. Don’t be egoistic though and feel overwhelmed by the love you receive. You deserve the best. All of our mistakes are already in the past, and I hope we will not be bothered by the baggage, got to know each other better, and learned from it. You don’t need to sacrifice any friends, goals, or anything about you for us, okii? I’m happy if you’re happy with it hehe don't mind what I said na before, I was wrong there... sorry it took me a while (nung mentally stable na ulit ako) to realize I generalized and ang tactless pala nun, and I don't want that too if I were in your shoes. You chose me so I hope you will choose me forever. Never doubt yourself and give up. I never doubted you and your capabilities, and I’ll always be grateful to be chased and pursued by you until we grow old, even when we are miles apart. Pareho tayong busy sa life pero this time we need to respect each other's time and already set our priorities straight, oki? We shouldn't be scared anymore of what the outcome of this relationship will be, because I know we'll always wait for each other (kahit when working na HAHA). We shouldn't also mind getting heartbreaks and tired from each other because love will make us conquer this all and we'll always be strong to work it out, okii? If you love me from the very start, you'll come back. Sometimes it might be your ex that you end up getting married to, you'll never know what fate will bring, but I trust this all to God's plan. We're both enough for each other, but remember to love yourself too... you're complete before I came to your life, so always feel the same even with me, and not find it in another person. Everyday is a learning experience, and I'm more confident through the prayers na we'll be together forever na this time in reaching our dreams hehe gotchu, you're worth it like a Gucci bag, okii? HAHA this is what you said to me when we were at our first month together while we were drinking and having 24 chicken at Kate's place *pinches your cheeks :p and pats your back* If I could just see you right now, I'll smile so wide for you, prepare the matcha drink I told you I'll bring in Taft, hug you as tight as we would always do, kiss you, and then hide after bc you might tickle me :(( HAHAHA. You're my first real true love. The One That Got Away. I know we have lots of wounds from our intense fight from before and it takes time to be okay again, but we are in this together, let’s not rush things but make it work, Kristian! Can we continue what we have paused from April, bubu? It's never too late, may it be years or so hihi I know you miss your baby too!! :* <br>
